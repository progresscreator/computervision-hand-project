Sobel edge detect / Create binary image
Compute axis of elongation for initial object: hand, arm				#arm_elongation
Find widest point of initial object: hand, arm							#palm_centroid
	Set palm_centroid to point of widest line perpendiuclar 
	to arm_elongation and intersection of arm_elongation
	
##
Post-implementation Notes:
Methods work well to locate palm centroid at most any orientation, frame placement, or size (perspective)
in relation to the camera. Accompanying image of lines of width search.
##

Search out from palm_centroid on arm_elongation looking
for greatest amount of directional blackspace. Mark direction
of highest amount of blackspace as fingertip_direction. 				#fingertip_direction

##
Post-implementation Notes:
Fingertip direction is found regardless of hand orientation, frame placement, size (perspective),
or number of fingers visible to the camera. Accompanying video.

fingertip.avi
The black line shows the direction of fingertips in the image. This directionality changes
as the fingertips move in the image. Also note the green palm centroid in the video, which sticks
to open and closed palms well and also shows success at sticking to sideways palms.
##


Find point at which arm_elongation hits the image-border
in the direction of fingertip_direction. Record this point
as finger_goal. Then find the initial object pixel that has				#finger_goal
the shortest euclidean distance to finger_goal.
Record this pixel as curr_finger_tip.									#curr_finger_tip

Record the euclidean distance from curr_finger_tip to
palm_centroid as tip_palm_dimension.									#tip_palm_dimension

Mark hand_region pixels as all initial object pixels 					#hand_region
falling within fingertip_direction of palm_centroid
parallel to arm_elongation.
